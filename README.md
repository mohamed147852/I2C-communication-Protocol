# I2C-communication-Protocol in Verilog

A complete implementation of the I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol designed in Verilog HDL, featuring both Master and Slave modules.
This project fully supports read/write operations, 7-bit addressing, ACK/NACK handling, and accurate START/STOP condition generation.

All modules are verified with a structured testbench and waveform simulations to ensure protocol-accurate timing and behavior.

🚀 Features

Master-side NACK generation after read completion
✅ I²C Slave Module
Address recognition (configurable address)
ACK generation for address & data
Data storage memory (128-byte array)
Supports read & write operations

🧪 Simulation
The protocol was verified using:

START → Address → ACK → Write → ACK → STOP
START → Address → ACK → Read → NACK → STOP
Full waveform inspection
SDA/SCL edge timing validation
Tri-state SDA correctness
Waveforms confirm complete I²C protocol compliance.
